[Data Security Node Inc.](http://www.datasecuritynode.com/){:target="_blank"} (DSN) is a 64,000 sq/ft nuclear bunker data center located in Nova Scotia, Canada. DSN provides hosted services and unique value added offerings, and is announcing a partnership with [Bitshares](https://www.bitshares.org/){:target="_blank"}, a one of a kind decentralized smart contract platform. Together, they are introducing a number of crypto-asset driven solutions to help usher in a new age of financial freedom and transparency.

Jonathan Baha’i, President of Data Security Node, explains, *“We have come to a place, technologically, where a revolution is about to happen at all levels of society - thanks to a new breed of blockchain driven technologies. [BitShares 2.0](https://bitshares.org/blog/2015/06/08/announcing-bitshares-2.0/) is at the crest of this movement, and we are absolutely thrilled to be joining forces with them.”*

The new partnership comes by way of a service offering from DSN called BunkerDEX which enables the exchange of crypto assets between multiple blockchains. Through the BitShares network, customers will be able to exchange virtual assets of all kinds, from popular crypto currencies like Bitcoin, to [SmartCoins](https://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies/) that hold the value of Dollars and Euro, to alternative banking solutions like bill and payment services that provide lower fees and less risk than most brick-and-mortar banks.

*“BunkerDEX will be the foundation for several offerings that connect to services from our bunker,” Jonathan continues “such as BunkerMining, The Canadian Rewards Debit, and S.A.F.E. (Synchronized Asset Futures Engine). We have some pretty amazing tools to work with now, thanks to the BitShares 2.0 platform.”*

*“Our nuclear bunker data center is the perfect place to host critical data, like financial transactions, that need a high level of protection.”* says Jonathan,  *“Most of us don’t expect nukes to fall from the sky any time soon, but the increasing appearance of natural disasters is actually a huge threat to data centers all around the world. Even data centers with sophisticated contingency planning have shown that they are helpless in the face of large scale natural disasters. For example, an Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), either manmade or by solar flares, would instantly destroy the electronics in most data centers. Due to the sophisticated construction of our bunker, we are the only solution in Canada that provides protection from these types of threats.”*

###BunkerMining

BunkerMining is a crypto mining pool that will soon pay miners in SmartCoins such as bitUSD and bitEuro, or by having real gold or silver drop-shipped to their door. BunkerMining will operate as a zero fee network thanks to the efficiencies it gains by operating through the BunkerDEX.

Paying miners in stable cryptocurrencies or real world assets such as gold and silver will be an in-demand feature according to Jonathan, *“Crypto miners have invested heavily in their operations, and have often been burned by the volatility (daily fluctuations in value) that crypto coins like Bitcoin experiences. In fact lately, we have even seen volatility in the markets for many national fiat currencies. With BunkerMining however, miners will have the freedom to choose which currency (SmartCoin) to cash in their earnings, or even to bypass currencies altogether and opt instead for real gold and silver.”*

Via the BunkerDEX, the BunkerMining operation will create a whole new index class that will be minable with the most popular hashing algorithms available. *“This will be a game changer for miners.”* explained Jonathan, *“The markets for various coins are constantly changing. Those that invest in mining hardware take on a risk that the value of the coins they mine today might not profit tomorrow. By using the BunkerMining pool, miners that use Scrypt mining rigs for example will also be able to benefit from increased value in Bitcoin, which is not a scrypt mined coin, as part of the index.”*

*“What’s even more exciting is the level of transparency we will be able to bring to our mining pool, and potentially our index could become another metric for measuring the current state of crypto.”* muses Jonathan,  *“Thanks to the support of the BitShares delegate system, during our initial growth phase will should be able to offer miners a higher ROI than anywhere else, and bonuses on payouts will constantly keep us among the most profitable mining pools.“*


###The Canadian Rewards Debit

Thanks to the BitShares’ high capacity network, the BunkerDEX will enable anyone with a SmartPhone to cash their cheques, pay bills online, and send money to their friends and family in any SmartCoin they choose.

*“Historically, Canadians have been the earliest adopters of new electronic payment technologies.”* Jonathan recalls, *“and we will appeal to them with a system that is convenient, easy to use, and secure - thanks to the decentralization of the BitShares network. Also, we have much lower overhead costs than a brick-and-mortar bank, so we will have much lower fees.”*

DSN will provide secure gateway transactions that will enable Canadians to easily transact their everyday banking and purchases in Canada and around the world. BitShares is decentralized, so every account holder has sole access to their funds. Because of this, account holders can enjoy the convenience of everyday banking transactions without the risk of bank failure. Add this to the first of its kind referral program that will be built into BitShares 2.0, and marketing to Canadians will be a no brainer.


###Synchronized Assets Futures Engine (S.A.F.E)

Saving the best for last, Jonathan beams, *“I have to say, I am most excited about the S.A.F.E. system we have created in tandem with [www.bunkershares.ca](http://www.bunkershares.ca/){:target="_blank"}, because it seems that technically we may have created an entirely new class of financial instrument. With the BitShares 2.0 network, we will be presenting a never before seen mechanism for online businesses to utilize. We think that S.A.F.E has the potential to spur a whole new industry.”*

To raise money for expanding operations, Data Security node will soon begin selling an asset called BunkerShares, which will be issued onto the BitShares Decentralized Exchange as User Issued Assets. SAFE will be a platform that provides businesses in high demand industries a way to raise money from investors without issuing securities. Instead, investors get to act as the middleman on every sale, and their investment is always protected against the potential for a liquidity crunch.

Return on investment for SAFE *“shareholders”* in a company have the potential to be much higher than traditional securities instruments, and could be comparable to what an equity investment return would have in the short term. Through the BitShares network, all transactions are decentralized and made public, so the entire system can be audited at any time by any shareholder. They do this simply by using a SAFE company’s online shopping cart to make a purchase.

SAFE aligns the incentives of investors and companies more harmoniously than traditional stocks, so investors in small businesses don’t have to wait years or longer for the chance to liquidate their holdings.

*“Because this is a brand new concept, we made a video [(SAFE Investment)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBhkyNnNU4k&feature=youtu.be){:target="_blank"} to help explain it in detail. In the video, we compare Wal-Mart gift cards to how S.A.F.E. can work for online businesses.”* Jonathan continues, *“I am confident from the feedback from prospective investors thus far that this new financial instrument backed by our technology is going to gain traction in the coming year as companies seek to diversify their capital sources.”*

*“With our nuclear bunker data center utilizing the BitShares 2.0 platform, I see a bright future ahead for us.”*

The BunkerShares 50 day sale will commence this fall, with the BunkerDEX following shortly afterwards.
