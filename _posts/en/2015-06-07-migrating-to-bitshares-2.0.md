title: Migrating to BitShares 2.0
---

--------

## Migration Path
<!--
(CryptoPrometheus: The first sentence was changed. For good PR, this sentence should not begin with the word "Unfortunately". Also, the "pitch fork" colloquialism, while perhaps it is cute, does not inspire confidence)
//-->
Upgrading to BitShares 2.0 will not just be a "hard fork". On an appointed date/time, a snapshot will be taken of all BitShares balances in all asset types.  The new chain will then launch within 24 hrs of the snapshot that discards all transaction history.  This snapshot will not be announced until we are 100% confident that the migration can occur in 
a timely manner.

## User Interface Migration
The new BitShares UI will be an entirely hosted wallet with private keys maintained in the browser and hosted at
bitshares.org.  Initially the only full client wallet will be command line and geared toward exchanges and servers.
Eventually a downloadable GUI wallet will be produced.

## BitAsset / User Issued Asset Migration
Because the new chain is a simple migration and should retain all the same "perceived value", we can migrate all
BitAssets and short positions.  The snapshot date will be announced with 30 days notice so that any shorts that do not
like the new BitAsset system can voluntarily exit.    To ease your migration we recommend that everyone upgrade to
BitShares 0.9.1 prior to the snapshot date and transfer 100% of every asset balance to yourself.  This will consolidate
your balances under a single account.

## Account Name Migration
Under BitShares 2.0, accounts are transferable and have different prices based upon the quality of the account name so that
they can double as DNS names.  Starting immediately, all BitShares delegates will only allow users to register non-premium names 
until BitShares 2.0 is released and can set the proper pricing.

## Open Order Migration
All open orders will be canceled prior to the snapshot and their funds returned to their owners.

## Wallet Migration
The BitShares 2.0 wallet architecture is vastly different than BitShares.  In BitShares, each account consists of dozens or
even thousands of keys, each of which is controlling a small portion of your balance and for TITAN users, none of the
balances associated with your account use the same key as your account.  Under BitShares 2.0, all of these "balances" become
unique accounts rather than a single logical account.    The BitShares 2.0 wallet will have an "import" interface that will
allow you to specify a set of private keys and the name of an account that you would like to receive all of the funds
associated with those keys.   Then it will generate a transaction that will spend the full balances from all accounts
associated with those keys to your new unified BitShares 2.0 account.    The BitShares 0.9.x wallet will provide a utility to dump
all private keys associated with a given account to make the migration process easy.

## Transaction History Migration
All transaction history will be abandoned.  If you need your transaction history you will have to reference your
BitShares 0.9.x wallet.

## Delegate Migration
All delegates will be migrated to a pair of witness and workers and maintain votes for both.  There should be no change
in income unless your worker and/or delegate get voted out.  Initially all witnesses will be assigned private keys that
are a shared secret between Invictus and the current delegates.  At any time the delegates can recover the private key
that allows them to change their block signing key and take control of their witness. 

## Exchange Migration
All exchanges will have at least 30 days to prepare for the new API which is significantly different from BitShares.  We
will encourage all exchanges to migrate as a Gateway.

## End of Life of BitShares 0.9.x
One the appointed snapshot date, BitShares 1.0 will shut down and all delegates will stop producing blocks.  This is to
prevent anyone from attempting to sell assets on the BitShares 1.0 chain.  It will be up to the individual delegates 
whether or not to continue BitShares 0.9.x and for the stakeholders to vote in new delegates to continue the chain. 

## Other Details

* Vesting balances will migrate under the existing terms, if two or more vesting balances were partially claimed
as part of the same transaction prior to the snapshot the vesting balances may be merged into a single balance.

## Deprecated Features
* Wall Messages will not be migrated as the feature is now deprecated 
* Asset description information is no longer part of the blockchain state
* Account Public Data is deprecated and is no longer part of the blockchain state
* Asset Public Data is deprecated and is no longer part of the blockchain state
