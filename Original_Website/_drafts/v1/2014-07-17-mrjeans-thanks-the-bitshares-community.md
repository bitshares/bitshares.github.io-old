I would like to take a moment to say a huge thank you to the BitShares team and the forum community. We are quick to complain when things dont go exactly our way but we are all sticking around and there are a few good reasons for that.

&nbsp;

Thank you for innovation after innovation. In a space that is only a few years old and where many programmers I know have no idea what Bitcoin is, (surprising actually), we have a team of people who fully understand the blockchain innovation and its potential.

&nbsp;

It is also fantastic that early adopters are able to join and become stakeholders in the new technology&#8230;.I love the openness BitShares uses when communicating with the stakeholders. The team has completely turned the concept of company hierarchy, patents, proprietary knowledge and copyright on its head! They have shown the power of community and the power of working together on open source work. The strange part is that they have worked out how to make all of this sustainable and profitable. Revolutionary!

&nbsp;

Thank you for the time and communication you have given to each member of the community. When I just started taking an interest in this project, I would keep bothering Stan with emails asking what now seams like very rookie questions. I also sent PMs and emails to Daniel. Each and every time I would get a personal response, and for people who I know are so busy that meant a lot to me. I have also worked with Brian on some tasks and he too was accessible and cool to talk to.

&nbsp;

I have spent many evenings sitting at the fireplace deep in thought about innovation and the constantly changing world. I have always wanted to be a part of a great movement and on the forefront of world change and innovation. Being a part of the Bitshares community gives me that chance.

&nbsp;

The services that BitsharesX will be able to provide the world will come with an immense amount of public good. It will provide stable banking services to the very poor, it will allow for increased access for all to markets, it will free people in countries with strict currency regulation to name a few benefits that stand out to me.

&nbsp;

Thank you for pushing this industry forward at an accelerating pace and for all the time and energy you have sacrificed for the community.

&nbsp;

I am sure the above speaks to the thoughts of many members of this community and not just my own.
