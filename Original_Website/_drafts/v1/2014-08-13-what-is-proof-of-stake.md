Proof of stake is an improvement over a prior concept known as proof of work (Bitcoin) and is used as a means to make it economically challenging to produce a counterfeit blockchain. Where proof of work requires a forger to do more make-work than all of the honest workers (miners) combined, proof of stake requires the forger to own a larger percentage of the crypto-currency money supply.

**Benefits of Proof of Stake**

  * Lower Transaction Fees
  * Faster
  * More Expensive to Attack
  * Lower barriers to Entry

When you view a crypto-currency as shares in a virtual company, proof of stake is similar to asking the shareholders to take turns signing the transaction ledger where as proof of work can be thought of having who ever can buy the most lottery tickets sign the ledger.

Proof of Stake was first proposed in March of 2012 on Bitcointalk. Since then there have been many implementations including Peercoin, Nxt, and BitSharesX each of which has slightly different variations on the theme. We learned from the challenges of these variations and are certain to have come to a logical conclusion with delegated proof of stake.

### **Delegated Proof of Stake**

Delegated proof of stake was first introduced in March of 2014 as a means of securing the BitSharesX blockchain. It makes several improvements over prior proof of stake systems including:

  * More People have a Voice
  * Bad Actors can be excluded regardless of stake.
  * Large shareholders need approval of smaller shareholders
  * Increases Flexibility
  * Maintains Decentralization at Scale
  * Optional Source of Trust

The primary idea behind Delegated Proof of Stake is that the “shareholders” delegate their block signing authority to 101 individuals, called delegates, who take it upon themselves to provide the most reliable and trusted block signing service possible. 101 individuals was deemed to be a compromise between centralization risks and the need to raise transaction fees to pay for additional people to verify the transaction ledger (blockchain).

Like other Proof of Stake systems Delegated Proof of Stake requires a large percentage of the share supply for an actor to gain control of the network. An attacker would require more support from the shareholders than 51 out of the top 101 “delegates”.
