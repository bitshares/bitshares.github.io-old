#### An* Environmentally Friendly* Solution.

&nbsp;

**in·cin·er·a·tor  **(n-sn-rtr)  n.

<p class="p1">
  … an apparatus, such as a furnace, for burning waste.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  Remember the incinerator?  Every big box store used to have one for burning empty cardboard shipping boxes.  Now-a-days that would be considered “environmentally unfriendly”.  You’re supposed to recycle, don’t you know?  Its good for the ecosystem.
</p>

  I think its time we talked about environmentally friendly crypto-equity mining.  At this very moment most BitShares PTS are being mined by sending money to outside companies to be burned up in high-tech incinerators.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  Amazon rents them, for example.  You send Amazon your money once a month.  They burn it up in their incinerators and then send you PTS proportional to the amount of money they burned up for you.  They have all kinds of incinerators to choose from if you care about how they burn your money.  They have CPU incinerators and GPU incinerators and if you want, someone will burn your money up on a high-powered ASIC incinerator.  New incinerators are being developed every day.  Most people don’t care how their money is burned up, as long as they get their expected number of shares.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  Invictus is researching a new kind of environmentally friendly incinerator replacement that we could make available to the crypto-equity community for any new DAC developer to use.  We call them “Angel Miners”.  As a black box, they work the same as all the others.  You send money to the incinerator operator and get back DACshares.  The difference is in how this incinerator disposes of your money.  Instead of burning it up and blowing the heat up a chimney, <i>the money gets recycled into the ecosystem!</i>
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p3" style="text-align: center;">
  <b>Yes, you heard that right, <i>your money gets recycled into the ecosystem</i>!</b>
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  Its used for developing better wallets, and new kinds of DACs, and browsers, and tools.  It goes for support hot-lines, and better documentation, and promotional videos, and maybe even Super Bowl ads.  All things that grow the ecosystem and increase the value of all its crypto-equities.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  Most people don’t care what kind of incinerator Amazon uses.  Now you have an environmentally responsible reason to choose!
</p>

&nbsp;

<p class="p1">
  DAC developers should clearly state in their promotional literature whether your mining software is eco-friendly or not.  Going green could make a difference in how the community embraces your product!
