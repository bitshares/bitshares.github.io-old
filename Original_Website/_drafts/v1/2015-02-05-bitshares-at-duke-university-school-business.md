On Thursday, Febuary 5,Â Daniel Larimer had the opportunity to present a two-hour lecture on behalf of Bitshares at Duke University, specifically the School of Business in Durham, North Carolina under invitation from Professor Campbell R. Harvey. The forty students taking this course are a mixture of computer science, business, and law majors who are interested in learning about starting entrepreneurial businesses in the crypto industry. The class is divided into eleven teams, each of which is required to develop a crypto business as part of their course objectives.

As you can probably imagine, Dan talked about Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs) and how to make them profitable. Among the opportunities he discussed were:

&nbsp;

1. Cloning the BitShares block chain using the BitShares Toolkit to produce independent businesses like MUSIC and PLAY.  
2. Adding your own business logic like VOTE and DNS to BitShares itself to leverage it&#8217;s delegates, community, currencies and network effect.  
3. Using BitShares User Issued Assets (UIA) to issue regulation compliant shares in a brick and mortar and flesh and blood company.  
4. What it takes to add your own Market Pegged Asset (MPA) to BitShares.  
5. The opportunity to create a business based on issuing one or more Prediction Market Assets (PMA).  
6. Becoming a BitShares Delegate and using that to bootstrap a startup business.  
7. Creating supporting business for third party add-ons, services, and products inside the emerging ecosystem.  
8. Crowd Funding vs. Crowd Hiring to bootstrap and sustain block chain based businesses.

&nbsp;

Dan&#8217;s lecture was recorded and we hope to publish some of his best riffs before long!
