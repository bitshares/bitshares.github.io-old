        The Virtual Mining of a cryptocurrency is any process that yields the same result as conventional cryptocurrency mining, but without the need to invest in hardware—whether by buying physical computers or by renting cloud services—Internet bandwidth, rack space, and electricity.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Remember that the idea of &#8216;mining&#8217; a cryptocurrency is only a very loose analogy described in a brief passage in §6 on p. 4 of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s White Paper under the heading, &#8216;Incentive &#8216;:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p style="padding-left: 30px;">
        By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. </span>In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. [emphasis added]
      </p>
      
      <p>
        That&#8217;s it. <span style="font-style: italic;">That one sentence </span>is where the term <span style="font-style: italic;">mine </span>and the related <span style="font-style: italic;">miner </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">mining </span>came from, as applied to the process of distributing new units of cryptocurrency to those who confirm transactions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Not only is this an analogy; it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">flawed </span>analogy. Gold miners do not mine <span style="font-style: italic;">coins</span>; they mine <span style="font-style: italic;">ore</span>, and refiners <span style="font-style: italic;">smelt </span>the ore into bullion that goldsmiths then <span style="font-style: italic;">mint </span>into coins. This three-step process is performed by three categorically different groups of individuals in the real world. When a system like Bitcoin releases new units to the lucky owner of the software process that completes the Proof-of-Work (POW) on a specific block of transactions first, the process is performed in one <span style="font-style: italic;">analogous </span>step.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In a system that adjusts the POW difficulty, in order to keep the flow of new units as close to constant as possible—approximately one block every ten minutes with Bitcoin—the more &#8216;miners&#8217; in the network, the lower the probability that any one of them will be the operator of the <span style="font-style: italic;">next </span>software process to win the current POW race. Because each has a quasi-equal chance of winning, each should win with approximately equal frequency over the long run.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the very early stages, perhaps only one &#8216;miner&#8217; confirms transactions. This miner has a 100% chance of being the next to win the POW race. When a second enters the market, the probability of each becomes 50%, assuming that each has equally powerful hardware with approximately equal bandwidth. When eight more enter the fray, the probability of success for each falls to 10%, and so on.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In order to gain an edge, each &#8216;miner&#8217; has an incentive to invest more and more and more in hardware and bandwidth. As each &#8216;miner&#8217; sets up more hardware, the costs of rack space and electricity become non-trivial, and the arm&#8217;s race continues, fueling the concentration of hashing power into the hands of the very few who can afford to maintain and continually upgrade warehouses of dedicated mining hardware that must be powered and cooled simultaneously.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Not only is this process wasteful, it enriches the suppliers of computer hardware, electricity, Internet bandwidth, and warehouse space, rather than members of the cryptocurrency community.

        &#8216;Virtual mining&#8217; mimics the outcome of &#8216;mining&#8217;, while reducing the drain on resources and keeping them within the community. One way to picture this is to imagine a black box, into which resources in the form of $ and ฿ are poured and cryptocurrency—here, BTS—emerges.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If the BTS/resource ratios of two different processes are equivalent, then one can argue that the processes should be treated as functionally and conceptually equivalent.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">BitShares</span>

        BitShares is a cryptocurrency system organized around the analogy of <span style="font-style: italic;">shares </span>rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">coins</span>. The BitShares developers have cloned Bitcoin and called their altcoin <span style="font-weight: bold;">Protoshares </span>(PTS). Note that, just as there are no <span style="font-style: italic;">coins </span>in Bitcoin, there are no <span style="font-style: italic;">shares </span>in the sense of fractional ownership of a registered firm in PTS. In fact, the BitShares developers see units of Bitcoin (<span style="font-style: italic;">bitcoins</span>, lowercase) as shares in a Distributed Autonomous Company (DAC), known as Bitcoin, in which its shares circulate as a medium of exchange and a store of value, and maybe one day even as a unit of account and a measure of value.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This idea of seeing shares as money is no stranger than using <a href="http://bkmarcus.com/cache/POW/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0.000000%, 0.000000%, 50.196000%);">cigarettes as money</span></a>, as R.A. Radford described in his 1945 article, &#8220;The Economic Organization of a POW Camp&#8221; (prisoner of war, <span style="font-style: italic;">not </span>proof-of-work). Perhaps stranger yet, if one lines up the cash flows of a firm side-by-side with those of a government, one can see that fiat currency maps to equity, as if the USD were shares of the US federal government! Whether one explains to the lay public what a cryptocurrency system does in terms of coins, shares, or anything else, the only thing that ultimately matters is <span style="font-style: italic;">what the software does</span>, rather that the <span style="font-style: italic;">analogies </span>that one uses to describe it.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The BitShares developers have created a &#8216;virtually mined&#8217; parallel to PTS that they call <span style="font-weight: bold;">AngelShares </span>(AGS). Just as there are no shares in Protoshares, there are no angels or shares in AngelShares; it&#8217;s just a name. However, the cryptocurrency user experience of each is very similar (with the salient difference being that AGS are not transferable).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With AGS, &#8216;virtual miners&#8217; &#8216;donate&#8217; any amount of PTS or Bitcoin that they want to an account that holds value on behalf of the BitShares community to cover the costs of development, marketing, promotion, bounties, etc. While these PTS and Bitcoin accounts are managed initially by BitShares founders, the proceeds are held for the benefit of the BitShares community as a whole, and not as the personal or corporate property of the parties holding them. (Records of PTS and bitcoins received and of the use of funds are posted publicly and discussed on an open BitShares forum.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;

<div class="page" title="Page 3">

    <div class="column">
      <p>
        In exchange, sponsors receive a fraction of the 5,000 AGS released <span style="font-style: italic;">that day</span>, in the same way that they would get, <span style="font-style: italic;">on average</span>, a fraction of the PTS—or Bitcoin, for that matter—&#8217;mined&#8217; that day, in proportion to their investments in hardware, bandwidth, electricity, etc., relative to the total amount invested by all &#8216;miners&#8217;.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With PTS, one downloads software, runs it either on one&#8217;s own computers (sending the money to the Apple Store or Best Buy, an ISP, and one&#8217;s local electric utility) or on a cloud host like Amazon Web Services (sending the money to Amazon), <span style="font-weight: bold;">in exchange for some percentage of the day&#8217;s 5,000 PTS that get awarded by the system</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        With AGS, one pays any amount that one chooses into one of two BitShares-community addresses— one for Bitcoin and one for PTS—<span style="font-weight: bold;">in exchange for some percentage of the day&#8217;s 5,000 AGS that get awarded by the system </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">and serve the same function as PTS</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In this way, the outcomes are essentially identical. Given that a) PTS is effectively a Bitcoin &#8216;altclone&#8217;, and b) the acquisition of AGS is essentially identical to that of PTS from the perspective of the &#8216;miner&#8217;/&#8217;virtual miner&#8217;, AGS should be viewed as functionally equivalent to PTS. The only salient difference between the two is that PTS holders can buy and sell their holdings amongst each other, and AGS holdings are tied to the specific Bitcoin or PTS addresses of those sponsors who have &#8216;donated&#8217; to the BitShares community, and are thus not transferable.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An alternative way of looking at it is that with PTS one must incur some expense and expend some effort, whereas with AGS one must incur some expense, and someone else expends the effort. In this way, &#8216;virtual mining&#8217; can be seen as similar to <span style="font-style: italic;">sponsoring </span>a &#8216;miner&#8217;, rather than <span style="font-style: italic;">being </span>a &#8216;miner&#8217;.
      </p>

        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What does one get, when one pays either Amazon Web Services, et al., for PTS or the BitShares community for AGS? One joins a pool of early adopters who have provided support for the development of, and who have bootstrapped a user base for BitShares.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The BitShares developers have embraced what they call their <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social Consensus </span>that results in a kind of <span style="font-style: italic;">metaphorical </span>tip jar, into which individuals and organizations that use BitShares sofware libraries to issue new DACs are expected to—although they cannot be compelled to—distribute at least 10% of their new issues to PTS holders and 10% to AGS holders.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether any of this will have value remains to be seen, just as it was unclear in 2010 and 2011 whether those who bought dedicated computers to &#8216;mine&#8217; bitcoins would see anything from their investments. Whether one &#8216;mines&#8217; PTS or &#8216;virtual mines&#8217; AGS, one is investing in a <span style="font-style: italic;">highly speculative hope</span>, and <span style="font-style: italic;">not in a reasonable expectation</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By way of contrast, let&#8217;s look at Bitcoin, the first DAC. With Bitcoin, the system pays 100% of the new DAC units—whether one chooses to call them &#8216;coins&#8217;, &#8216;shares&#8217;, &#8216;patronage points&#8217;, &#8216;ether&#8217;, or whatever— to supporters who include both mine-&-hold and mine-&-dump operators. When Bitcoin is viewed as a &#8216;company&#8217;, bitcoin holders own transferable, non-voting capital shares, and the &#8216;miners&#8217; serve the role of employees or contractors, who are paid for their services, and who hold all of the voting power, even if they do not hold the bitcoins that they &#8216;mine&#8217; longer than it takes to sell them. The closest analogy to this kind of governance structure is the family-owned combines that one finds in many parts of the Developing World, where voting shares are concentrated in the hands of a single family, and outside investors own non-voting shares that might or might not pay dividends.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to mimic more closely the kind of governance structure that one finds in countries that tend to attract a lot of foreign capital, the BitShares developers have chosen to incorporate Proof-of-Stake (POS)—the technical details of which are beyond the scope of this essay—which distributes voting power among holders in proportion with the size of their holdings, similar to the one-vote-per-share of conventional corporate governance.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here, the DAC issues new units—whether one chooses to call them &#8216;coins&#8217;, &#8216;shares&#8217;, &#8216;partonage points&#8217;, &#8216;ether&#8217;, or whatever —as a firm&#8217;s executives issue shares, and it then offers them to anyone who wants to acquire them. Granted, in most jurisdictions, rules are in place that restrict the offering of shares for sale to the public, and this can be a source of great confusion when using homonyms for legal terms. (See &#8220;<a href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/a-bitrose-by-any-other-name/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(0.000000%, 0.000000%, 50.196000%);">A BitRose by Any Other Name</span></a>&#8221; for a discussion on this last point.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Thus, it bears repeating: There are no coins in Bitcoin, and there are no shares in BitShares. One can refer to the units created by the software as &#8216;bluebacks&#8217;, &#8216;galactic credits&#8217;, &#8216;latinum&#8217;, or &#8216;quatloo&#8217;, if one wants, but this adds unnecessary vagueness and even more confusion than referring to them <span style="font-style: italic;">metaphorically </span>as &#8216;coins&#8217; or &#8216;shares&#8217;. (It also reveals one&#8217;s preferences in popular entertainment.)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whatever one chooses to call them, for those units to have any hope of eventually being seen as valuable by market participants, they must be in circulation. To get them into circulation, one can give them away, try to sell them, or some combination of these.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The BitShares Social Consensus holds that anyone who uses BitShares software libraries to create DACs should pay a voluntary gratuity to those who provided resources to help develop the system. This is as unenforceable as paying a tip to a waiter or waitress, and yet this social convention is obeyed by those of us from cultures where tipping is the norm, even when we are away from our hometowns, and we do not expect to see the waiter or waitress ever again.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The rule-of-thumb is that the creator of the DAC should give 10% of its units to AGS holders and 10% to PTS holders. The BitShares system distributes the units to the holders in proportion to the relative sizes of their holdings. Of course, the creator of the DAC is welcome to apportion more than 10% each to the AGS and PTS holders.
      </p>

      <p>
        By tipping AGS and PTS holders, one gets some of a new DAC&#8217;s units into the hands of persons who have demonstrated an interest in the long-term success of BitShares DACs. On the one hand, AGS holders have &#8216;virtually mined&#8217; their positions by giving bitcoins or PTS the the BitShares community directly, in lieu of giving money to hardware and Internet service suppliers. On the other hand, whoever mines-&-holds <span style="font-style: italic;">or </span>buys-&-holds PTS likewise has expended resources, in order to participate in the early stages of new BitShares DACs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When choosing whether to &#8216;mine&#8217; PTS, buy PTS, or &#8216;virtually mine&#8217; AGS, one should compare the costs of each, and watch for market discrepancies. As we see with Bitcoin even after several years of operation, thin markets often are volatile and create opportunities to buy one position at a lower price than another, even though one believes that one will achieve the same outcome from each.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        &nbsp;
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In conclusion, although it really should go without saying, none of the above should be construed as investment advice. Never invest more than you are prepared to lose, and avoid investing in anything that you cannot draw a picture of on a sidewalk (pavement) with a piece of chalk.
