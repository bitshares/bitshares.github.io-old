Bitcoin and BitShares offer complementary ways to escape looming financial hazards.

Every Bitcoin user knows how empowering it is to send electronic cash anywhere in the world in minutes, not days, without paying and obeying a middleman.  In many ways, Bitcoin is making your old checking account obsolete.  The number of businesses that accept Bitcoin is growing rapidly and you can set up your own financial network with everyone that runs the free Bitcoin app.

The need to pay a bank to process a check or expose your credit card number to make a purchase is simply vanishing.  Along with it goes the risk of revealing your sensitive private information to others you may not trust.  After using Bitcoin style checking, most want to do all transactions that way.  Opportunities are everywhere as merchants discover new ways to dodge credit card fees.

But Bitcoin may be a bit too much like your checking account. It doesn’t pay interest and you have to be on your toes because bitcoins tend to fluctuate in value. So, like checking accounts, people don’t store much money in Bitcoin.  Most keep just what they plan to spend in the near term. The rest they squirrel away somewhere stable and safe where it can earn a decent rate of return.  If there was such a place, that is.

That’s where BitShares comes in.  BitShares is a second-generation version of bitcoin that can be configured to track the value of a basket of other currencies.  You can set your coins to track the value of Dollars, Euros, Yuan, Bitcoins, Gold, Silver, Oil and many other assets.  You can even set up several mixes to balance your risks and rewards and switch between them as often as you like. Find the mix that’s right for you then sleep well tonight!

BitShares is like having your savings account, stockbroker, Swiss bank and currency exchange all rolled up in a digital coin that can change how it works like a chameleon on your command.   Grandmas can use BitShares like a simple savings account while speculators use it like a powerful new day trading console.

BitShares works just like Bitcoin only better in every way.  Transaction times are ten seconds not the hour it can take Bitcoin or even days for the global banking cartels.  You can send payments to people by name like an email but with unprecedented privacy.  What happens in BitShares stays in BitShares.

Your funds are safe from a multitude of risks we all suffer inside the current system. Governments, banks, and criminal enterprises can’t touch your funds because there is no central point they can attack. Your money is protected in a robotically honest, incorruptible public ledger spread across thousands of computers in jurisdictions spanning every time zone.  It can’t be lost, frozen, seized, diluted, front-run, clawed-back, bailed-in, rehypothicated, deflected, selected, detected, rejected, neglected or inspected by anyone but you.

Bitcoin and BitShares are your new complementary checking and savings accounts – engineered to help mitigate the escalating risks of the global financial system. Now you can run your own sovereign financial empire and small town piggy bank – from your hammock under a palm tree on a quiet beach in Kokomo.
