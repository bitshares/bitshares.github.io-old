Adam Kaleb Ernest, Founder and CEO of Follow My Vote was recently invited out to the national summit meeting for the Pirate Party of Norway. Ernest gave a speech on Follow My Vote&#8217;s verifiable online voting platform that is powered by BitShares. This was a great chance for exposure for both Follow My vote and BitShares. The speech was received well by Pirate Party members and citizens of Norway.

&#8220;The Pirate Party exists across 6 continents and in approximately <a title="List of Pirate Parties" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pirate_Parties" target="_blank">61 countries</a> throughout the world (including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, China, India, Russia, Israel, Switzerland, Germany, France, Spain, Morocco, Brazil, Argentina, and the United Kingdom). The European Pirate Party is also active within the European Union. Generally, the Pirate Parties support civil rights, direct democracy and participation in government, reform of copyright and patent law, free sharing of knowledge (open content), information privacy, transparency, freedom of information, anti-corruption and network neutrality.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;The Pirate Party of Norway aims to serve as an example to the rest of the world by embracing cutting-edge technology in order to provide transparency into the political process.&#8221;

&nbsp;

&#8220;This meeting, which is held annually in Oslo, Norway, took place on March 21-22. Ernest, was originally invited to speak for approximately 45 minutes; however, due to the active engagement and participation from the audience, his presentation lasted nearly 90 minutes.&#8221;
