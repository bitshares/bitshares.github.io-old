#### Much more than an altcoin.

&nbsp;

While others are promoting single unbacked coins or one chain to rule them all, we are about to jump-start an entire new industry!

&nbsp;

That bears taking a little extra time to savor every word:

&nbsp;

> Incubating a multi-sector industry  
> of strategic partners and independent developers  
> for multiple prototype franchises of crypto-equities as  
> shares of profit-generating unmanned companies

&nbsp;

**So, what’s a BitShares Prototype?**

&nbsp;

A BTS prototype is any crypto-asset that gets some of its value from the fact that its shares represent an interest in one or more future crypto-equity products. They are assets whose value is derived from the market’s anticipated future value of a product line, company or even an industry.

&nbsp;

A BTS family is just a group of crypto-assets that have all been derived from a common BTS prototype. You can think of them as franchises that enable developers to quickly gain support for a new idea &#8211; without waiting for the world to discover them. Usually they have something in common — so you can speculate on them as a group.

&nbsp;

So the proto-families shown in our family tree are just the first prototypes of representative DACs in that family. We like to start each franchise with a very simple instance to be the prototype for the rest. For example, a periodic lottery was the simplest we could think of for the gaming sector. Then all other’s fork from the prototype with different or competing business models. There are bound to be different instances for different regions, cultures, and legal jurisdictions. The opportunities for entrepreneurs and developers are unlimited.

&nbsp;

To summarize: BTS Prototypes are sample Decentralized Autonomous Companies (DACs) that serve as:

&nbsp;

  * A reference prototype and working example for others to evaluate and specialize.
  * A forking point for initializing ownership to a group that has demonstrated a willingness to invest in this specific sector. (This is huge, developers now know who they should really want to please most.)
  * A salute to AGS / PTS holders who are still honored because they were already given their stake in the market sector when the prototype was launched. They either held or sold those shares, and now it is the current holders of those shares that will value complementary shares in your new DAC the most.
  * A way to trade interests in a specific sector where share value reflects the market’s assessment of the expected value of a particular family of DACs. (Expected value is the integral of the projected market cap of all such DACs times the probability that they will be successfully implemented.)

&nbsp;

What makes this whole concept so powerful is that   it is in a DAC developer’s own interest to attract those likely to invest still more in them.   Nobody else in the whole world is more likely to buy up your DAC’s fund-raising shares than  people who already have demonstrated interest in your market sector with their own money  — especially if they have been given a stake in your genesis block to whet their appetite!

&nbsp;

Developers! Don’t give your shares away to just anybody. Most will just dump them for pizza — and suppress your price. Give them instead to BTS prototype shareholders who have arguably proven they  will buy and hold them — and buy more of them — boosting your price!

&nbsp;

**What gives BTS prototypes their unique 4-way value?**  
Most alt coins have value for one reason &#8211; speculation. That’s fine, but BTS Prototypes benefit from three additional factors:

&nbsp;

1. It is a digital company, designed to earn and share its profits with those who hold its “shares”.  
2. Its “shares” go up in value as it earns more profits &#8211; not just because of transient “hype”.  
3. Its shares represent a potential to receive promotional shares in all future clones derived from it.

&nbsp;

And yes, they gain from speculative hype too. But it’s a rational hype based on something tangible. Something for which you can actually do a credible analytical market value analysis.

  <strong>What are DAC fund raising shares?</strong>
</p>

These are shares that our community is happy to let developer’s keep to help fund the development of  great DACs. As long as you honor your proto-family’s share-holders with their 20% you still have 80%  to allocate in whatever way you think will make your DAC successful. You can even keep them all for your own personal gain (if you really think that will make your DAC successful). Hint: your  competitors will love it if you do, since it will be easy for them to fork a better deal for your former  supporters! You can sell these shares or use a simulated mining approach to designate them like AGS.

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>What about your allocation is wise and fair? </strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Certainly it makes business sense for you to keep 10 or 20% to develop and continue to support a DAC  while it is still young. Maybe more if your DAC is complex. It might also make sense to reserve some of the shares to attract the customer base you are trying to target. Gaming DACs in particular could use some of that 80% for initial prizes and jackpots until they can get enough prize money from revenues.
