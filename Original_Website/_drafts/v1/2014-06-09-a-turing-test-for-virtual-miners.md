&nbsp;

<span style="color: #515151;">Dr. Charles Evans recently defined the <a title="Virtual Mining" href="http://bitshares.org/virtual-mining/" target="_blank">Virtual Mining</a> of a cryptocurrency as &#8220;any process that yields the same result as conventional cryptocurrency mining, but without [actually mining].&#8221;   Of course he was talking about the &#8220;fair asset distribution&#8221; function of mining not the &#8220;network security&#8221; function.  Both uses of traditional proof of work mining are obsolete, but this article focuses only on alternatives for &#8220;fair&#8221; asset distribution.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #515151;">Here we compare six canonical virtual miners using a variation on Alan Turing&#8217;s famous 1956 <em>Turing Test:</em></span>

  <em>“A machine inside a back box may be deemed intelligent if a person interacting from outside the box can’t determine whether they are talking to a machine or a human.”</em>
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <p>
    &nbsp;<br /> This inspired our “Turing Test for Virtual Miners”, which we stated this way:

    <em>“A machine inside a black box may be deemed to be mining if an outside human can’t determine whether the box contains a proof of work algorithm or a vending machine.”</em>

    <strong>Black Box.</strong>  In science and engineering, a <em>black box</em> is a device, system or object that can be viewed in terms of its input, output and the transfer function between them without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is &#8220;opaque&#8221; (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, the human brain [or a crypto-asset miner].  – Wikipedia

      So which is better?  A vending machine that burns the money it receives or one that uses the money to increase the value of the product it is vending?  Either way the user exchanges value for value.  Does she care what happens to the money deposited if the product is reliably dispensed?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our January BitShares AGS innovation task was simple.  Invent a replacement vending machine that would capture the money being burned so it could be used to build the industry.  If Bitcoin would do that, its community could capture about $500,000,000 dollars per year to develop the industry.  Yep, that’s how much is wasted through mining.  And how do ordinary people get their bitcoins today?  Sadly, they pay full market price at their favorite bitcoin exchange.

      Mining is just a boat anchor on the industry.  An albatross around its neck.  It is not a way to give everyone a fair chance at free bitcoins.  It hasn&#8217;t been for years.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But what new fair distribution vending machine design might <em>developers and users and regulators </em>be willing to accept?
    </p>

    <h4>
      <strong>Black Box Vending Machine Options</strong>
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All of the black boxes listed below are designed to have identical functions:  <em>A number of tokens are allotted for release from time to time.  Each release round, your expected share is proportional to the money you supply divided by the money everyone supplies.  </em>Fair and simple!  Now let&#8217;s look at six ways to make it complicated:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #1 – Mining Pool.</strong>  Inside the box, the money you paid goes to rent a number of computers in a mining farm.  All the computers that everyone has rented for the round compete to find a magic number.  When one is found, the box divides the winnings among the pool members proportional to the number of computers they rented. The money collected pays for the rented computers and is lost to the industry.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #2 – Indirect Mining.</strong>  Inside the box, the machine gives your payment to another vending machine in exchange for some more profitable asset, which it then sells <em>in the market</em> to get money to purchase the asset that you want <em>from the market</em> at full price.  You get the number of tokens it was able to purchase for you, but all the money you deposited was lost to the industry in the other vending machine.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #3 – Lottery Pool.</strong>  Inside the box a lottery ticket is generated for every unit of money deposited.  Occasionally the machine randomly picks a winning ticket.  It then divides the winnings among the pool players proportionally to their contribution to the pool. The money collected goes to a development trust to grow the value of the tokens you received.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #4 – Batch Sale.</strong>  Inside the box, an average unit price is computed based on  the total everybody paid divided by number of units available.   You recieve the number of units your contribution will buy at that price. The money collected goes to a development trust to grow the value of the tokens you received.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #5 – Proof You Worked. </strong>Inside the box the machine considers the money you deposited to be proof that you worked, presumably doing the most profitable thing you know how to do. The value of your work is divided by the total value of work everybody did and you get that percent of the round’s allotment. This is the same as number 4 but it sounds more like mining, so maybe people will accept it more than a simple batch sale.  The money collected goes to a development trust to grow the value of the tokens you received.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Black Box Vending Machine #6 – Proof of Giving. </strong>Inside the box, your money is donated directly to a trust to promote the industry.  All the box does is publish a receipt for your donation on a public block chain.   You <em>hope</em> that other developers will target you with an airdrop of their free samples because they want the support of proven donors like you, because they want the good will of the community, because they want recognition from the development trust and/or because they want to support this method as a way to grow the industry.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While all six types (if they work at all) are designed to produce the same results, each has its implementation pros and cons.  The first two are already popular, but they waste all the money people are willing to pay for the product and do nothing to grow the industry.  The next three capture 100% of the proceeds to grow the industry but use methods that might encounter regulatory entanglements if someone were to look inside the box.  (Why should different regulations apply anyway if all boxes produce the same acceptable result?  But we digress.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Method 6, <em>Proof of Giving</em>, is based upon unproven <em>BitShares Airdrop Theory</em>. It is attractive (if it actually works) because it is the only method that avoids regulatory entanglements while capturing 100% of the proceeds to grow the industry.  There is nothing to regulate because <em>nothing is promised in return from the black box</em>.  All inputs are by definition no-strings-attached gifts to be used as the box sees fit.    It is an electronic street canvaser&#8217;s donation box with publicly documented donations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Like all six box types, people can imagine whatever form of virtual mining they like is going on inside the black box, but in Box 6 all the giver actually gets is a public acknowledgement and satisfaction from helping to grow the industry.  Any additional hoped for benefit is based only on the theoretical <em>possibility</em> that third party developers might, for their own inscrutable reasons, independently <em>choose to</em> &#8220;airdrop&#8221; some free promotional assets on them because they represent the rarest of all demographics &#8211; <em>people who donate to developers</em>!  We include all those independent developers inside the arbitrary engineering definition of Box Type Six whose design is based upon a specific unproven theoretical model of what the behavior of those independent developers will be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “Hey, wait a minute” cries a heckler in the back of the room, “you can’t prove that Black Box #6 has the same transfer function as all the other boxes!  Those third party developers are independent and might do anything else they choose!   Your box could produce higher or lower value results than the others, or none at all!&#8221;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Indeed. It has an untested design which, like most of what Invictus <em>Innovations</em> does, is only <em>intended and expected</em> to work as specified.  There is a compelling argument for why it <em>should</em> work as designed, but being an experimental prototype, it could fail. The only way to find out was to test it!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So we created BitShares AGS.  We stated as clearly as possible what was actually inside the box and our theory for why the box should work as a better alternative to all the other black box implementations known at the time.  During the months that followed, we have continued to work on our ability to explain the fine points of BitShares Airdrop Theory.  Some of the most significant precursor posts are featured right here in this blog:

        &nbsp;<br /> Whether Proof of Giving becomes an acceptable form of virtual mining depends on the viability of emerging <em>BitShares Airdrop Theory </em>and a social consensus about what constitutes honorable developer behavior. We will cover that next.  Until then, here&#8217;s our best existing forum post on the subject:
