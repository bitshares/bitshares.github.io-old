  BitShares strives to be to business what Bitcoin is to money. This ambitious goal is made possible by Satoshi Nakamoto’s solution in 2008 to a problem in distributed computing that had been declared impossible to solve since the 1970s. However, as is always the case with new technology, the language often lacks words for the new concepts associated with the innovation, as we are forced to use existing words in strange new ways, as our ancestors did when faced with the ‘horseless carriage’ (automobile), ‘talking picture’ (movie), or ‘information superhighway’ (Internet).
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  As noted in the Montague Institute Review article, “IT Neologisms: Necessary but Dangerous” from January 2010:To make sense of rapid change, we are inclined to make incremental alterations to our existing world view—much like adding a patch to a comfortable shirt. A good example is the phrase “horseless carriage,” a kind of neologism that helped people absorb the concept of a self-propelled vehicle. Although they can be expedient in the short term, most neologisms are eventually replaced by other terms that more accurately reflect the new reality. In the meantime, they can confuse both developers and consumers, increase costs, and obscure the true nature of change.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Thus, while it is true that words have meanings, it is equally true that a rose by any other name is still a rose.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Many words often have several very different meanings simultaneously, or different meanings in different contexts. Some words—like ‘cleave’, ‘sanction’, and ‘dust’— are even their own antonyms. Sometimes we invoke similes and analogies. At other times, one might resort to sarcasm, which is stating the exact opposite of what means for dramatic effect. If one holds that sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, one might opt for sardonicism, which is stating what one means but in a sarcastic tone, typically as either understatement or hyperbole.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Most of us, who are familiar enough with Bitcoin to explain it to others, know that there are no ‘coins’ to be ‘mined’, as if coins were mined in the real world. Ore is mined, and coins are minted, which has nothing to do with how they smell or taste. These are similes and analogies. To fixate on their literal meanings is foolish, if not disingenuous.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  However one describes what a piece of software does, it does what it does; no more and no less, and no matter what natural language words one uses to describe it. If one truly wants to understand what Bitcoin, BitShares, Ethereum, Linux, or any other software does, one must analyze the source code. Nonetheless, some individuals seem to derive perverse delight in taking similes and analogies literally and pretending to find controversy where none exists. Whether this is playing Devil’s Advocate, impish trolling, or some form of narcissistic cry for attention, it can lead to economic harm to the party whose words are willfully misinterpreted.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  For example, a reasonable person recognizes “Invest in a professionally maintained luxury sedan…” to be a call to buy a used car. If someone of ill will reported the used car dealer to financial regulators for soliciting unregistered investments that consistently lose value—”You said ‘invest‘!”—even if the dealer prevailed, he or she still would have to hire a lawyer, take time out of an already busy workday to rebut the spurious claim, and repair his or her reputation.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  In a field as young and dynamic as crypto currency, it is unsurprising that we have faux controversy in abundance. Very few in the general public understand Bitcoin, and those who are working on Crypto currency 2.0 projects like BitShares, colored coins, Ethereum, Mastercoin, or Ripple might as well be engaging in wizardry, as far as all but the insiders are concerned. Still, that does not stop some wags and gadflies from imagining that they witness nefarious skullduggery and declare their dark fantasies and uninformed opinions to be immutable facts. Those on the receiving end of this often pseudonymous misquoting, misinterpretation, and outright lies must choose between ignoring the false claims or engaging in conversation that often just digs one deeper into a pit of falsehoods. (That last bit is a simile.) Neither option is particularly appealing. On an open forum, the choice is unavoidable.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  This brings us to BitShares, and by extension all crypto currency 2.0 innovations.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  There are no shares in BitShares. Any references made to ‘shares’, ‘investments’, ‘dividends’, ‘banks’, etc. by the principals have been and are analogies, intended to help the lay reader form a mental image of what the software does. Such references are invocations of familiar concepts presented as similes, rather than as metaphors. An example of a simile is, “The USA is the 800-pound gorilla of capital markets.” Clearly, the USA is not a great ape native to the rainforests of Sub-Saharan Africa. It is a country, just south of Canada and west of the Bahamas.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  To argue that the authors of the BitShares software should be subject to securities regulation is as nonsensical as arguing that, because it is illegal to own gorillas in most jurisdictions within the USA, the person using the analogy above is advocating animal endangerment. Even if one invoked a metaphor, such as “The USA is like an 800-pound gorilla…” that would be little better than saying that features of BitShares are like shares, like investments, like dividends, like banks, etc.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Likewise, calls to regulate Ethereum are as nonsensical as calling for the regulation of C++, Java, Python, or Ruby.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Granted, regulation might apply to the use of the software, but that is another matter. The point here is about reading features into a brand name or an analogy used to explain what a piece of software does that simply are not there.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  The Federal Reserve does not issue Linden Dollars. There is no gold in Reddit Gold or in an American Express gold card. The US Treasury Department does not operate American Express. The US Department of Transportation does not operate Federal Express. The winner of a game of Monopoly is not guilty of violating the Sherman Act of 1890. The House of Windsor does not produce Royal Crown Cola. There is no coca in Coca Cola. There is no anesthetic in Ethereum.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  When Daniel Larimer coined the term ‘Decentralized Autonomous Company’ (DAC), and declared Bitcoin to be the first DAC, he was using the term ‘company’ as an analogy to help the lay public form a mental image. Similarly, when he named his software for creating subsequent DACs ‘BitShares’, he meant that one could draw a cartoon depicting one’s crypto-currency holdings as ‘shares‘, rather than ‘coins‘. (As a side note, this is analogous to mapping the cash flows of a firm to those of a government, and noting that corporate shares correspond to fiat money, and that USD can be seen as shares in the US federal government.)
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  In other words, Bitcoin-the-system can be viewed as a DAC, where each bitcoin-the-unit represents one share in the distributed, self-organizing, self-enforcing ‘company‘ that we call Bitcoin. The change of analytical framework from coins to shares makes seeing ways to improve Bitcoin-the-company more straightforward.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  For example, the primary goal of a firm—more accurately, the firm’s shareholders—is to maximize profits. This is not to be confused with minimizing costs or maximizing revenues. If one wants to minimize costs, one can reduce them to zero by shutting down. At the other extreme, if one wants to maximize revenues, one ends up pushing one’s equipment and employees to the breaking point. The optimal scale is the one that maximizes the difference between revenues and costs, which is in a kind of ‘Goldilocks Zone’ between ‘too big’ and ‘too little’.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  When we think of Bitcoin as an issuer of coins, efficiency is a secondary concern. If the network slows down, just throw more silicon-&-electricity at it. In fact, the Proof-of-Work used to secure the Bitcoin system embraces inefficiency as a core feature. However, when we think of Bitcoin as an issuer of shares, efficiency becomes one of the primary concerns, and more efficient alternatives to Proof-of-Work become more desirable.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  One alternative is Proof-of-Stake, which secures a system by having the ‘shareholders’ vote on the valid transaction ledger in proportion to their holdings. In this way, those who own the system secure the system without having to spend huge amounts of resources on doing more work than any attacker can.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Of course, Bitcoin developers could replace Proof-of-Work with Proof-of-Stake, but they would need the cooperation of the transaction processors, known metaphorically as ‘miners’, as they control the majority of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin system. In other words, seen as a company, the holders of bitcoin-the-unit own non-voting shares. The miners have all of the voting power.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  As a payment protocol, this obviously is not a devastating problem. Otherwise, Bitcoin would not exist. As a company, on the other hand, this is like having the vast majority of shares in circulation stripped of their voting rights, and all of the voting power concentrated in the hands of a small number of parties who might not even hold the bitcoins longer than it takes to sell them that they receive in payment for their services. This situation is unusual in countries that tend to attract a lot of foreign investment, like Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. It is much more like the large, family-owned combines that one sees in the Developing World.
</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="color: #1b485d;">
  Carrying the company analogy a bit further, the goal of maximizing the ‘equity-per-share’ ratio replaces the goal of maintaining a constant ‘backing-per-currency-unit’ ratio in a currency system. With a currency, the general tendency is to strive for a stable price-per-stuff ratio. Granted, one can argue in favor of a truly deflationary currency, but this continues to be a minority view, and the default is stable prices for the vast majority of currency users. Shares, on the other hand, are expected to pay dividends, appreciate in value, or both. When we think of a DAC as a company, rather than as a mint, the idea of units that increase in value comes more naturally.
