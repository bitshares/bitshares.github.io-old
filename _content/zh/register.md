## Step 1 - Download Software
The first step is to download and install the BitShares client.

{% include download.html %}

After you have downloaded the latest version for your computer and installed the BitShares application, start it up and
accept the license. You should then be presented with a screen asking you to set your wallet password.

Your password is used to protect your wallet, which contains your private keys while they are stored on your computer.
Be sure to use a reasonably strong password and that your password is not used anywhere else.

**NOTE: Do not assume that if you remember your password that you can recover your funds from another computer just
because it has BitShares installed. We will walk you through the process of backing up your wallet in a later step.**

## Step 2 - Create an Account
The next step is to create an account where you should be presented with a screen similar to
the screen shown below:

Once you have chosen an account name that you are happy with, click the Create New Account button.

**NOTE: An account is a named public key that allows you to receive funds, login to websites, and sign messages. A wallet
can contain one or more accounts, which means that you can create multiple accounts within your wallet, so there’s no
need to worry about picking the perfect name.**

After clicking Create New Account you will have what is known as an unregistered account, as shown below:

**NOTE: An unregistered account is like an unlisted phone number. No one knows about it unless you share the Account Key
with them and they manually add it as a contact.**

## Step 3 - Register Account
The next step is to register an account by
clicking the blue button to the right of your account name.

This will bring up a dialog that asks you how you would like to pay the transaction fee required to register your newly
created account:

<img src="/images/get-started/5_register_account.png" width="800px" />

**NOTE: Because this is your first account and you have no funds, you are given an option for the BitShares faucet to pay
your transaction fee on your behalf.**

Now, click the blue Register button, which will open your web browser and take you to faucet.bitshares

<img src="/images/get-started/6_register_account_arrow.png" width="800px" />

Once you’ve reached faucet.bitshares.org, you will be asked to login via one of several different services that most
people already have an account with:

<img src="/images/get-started/7_faucet.png" width="800px" />

**NOTE: This is done to prevent abuse of the free faucet registration service only. Your BitShares account is not publicly
tied to the service you choose to login with.**

After logging in via one of these services, the faucet gives you an opportunity to share your new account with your
friends, if you like:

**NOTE: Regardless of whether or not you chose to share your new account, your account will automatically and instantly be
registered on the blockchain.**

When you return to your wallet, your account should be shown as a Registered account:

<img src="/images/get-started/10_account_registered_arrow.png" width="800px" />

Welcome to the blockchain! Reaching this step means you have successfully created and registered your account with the
blockchain and may now use it to receive funds. If you run into any problems following the steps above, there are very
helpful people on the BitShares forum who will be more than willing to help!

## Step 4 - Backup Wallet
As a best practice, you should create a backup copy of your wallet. To backup your wallet, go to the File menu and
select Export Wallet:

Your password is used to protect your wallet, which contains your private keys while they are stored on your
computer. Be sure to use a reasonably strong password and that your password is not used anywhere else.

**NOTE: We recommend backing up your wallet to one or more USB sticks and storing them in a safe location. As long as
you have access to this first backup you should be able to recover any accounts and balances that you have in the
future. Just be sure you don’t forget your wallet password from the first step.**

At this point, the BitShares application will ask you for a location to save your wallet file. Select the location
of your choosing, click Save, and you are done!

**NOTE: While you only have to do this once to recover your balances, we recommend that you do this periodically to
avoid losing your transaction history.**
