This tutorial will walk you through the process of getting a fully functional registered account on the BitShares blockchain.

## Step 1 - Download Software
The first step is to download and install the BitShares client.

{% include download.html %}

After you have downloaded the latest version for your computer and installed the BitShares application, start it up and
accept the license. You should then be presented with a screen asking you to set your wallet password.

Your password is used to protect your wallet, which contains your private keys while they are stored on your computer.
Be sure to use a reasonably strong password and that your password is not used anywhere else.

**NOTE: Do not assume that if you remember your password that you can recover your funds from another computer just
because it has BitShares installed. We will walk you through the process of backing up your wallet in a later step.**

## Step 2 - Create an Account
The next step is to create an account where you should be presented with a screen similar to
the screen shown below:

Once you have chosen an account name that you are happy with, click the Create New Account button.

**NOTE: An account is a named public key that allows you to receive funds, login to websites, and sign messages. A wallet
can contain one or more accounts, which means that you can create multiple accounts within your wallet, so there’s no
need to worry about picking the perfect name.**

After clicking Create New Account you will be registered automatically, as shown below:

## Step 4 - Backup Wallet
As a best practice, you should create a backup copy of your wallet right now.
To backup your wallet, to the wallet management console as shown below.

Your password is used to protect your wallet, which contains your private keys while they are stored on your
computer. Be sure to use a reasonably strong password and that your password is not used anywhere else.

Provide the password defined at when you created your accounts:

At this point, the BitShares application will ask you to verify the so called
brain key which can be used to recover all your accounts created in your
wallet.

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/get-started/7_copy_brainkey.png" width="432px" />

Write down the brain key and store it safely. It will allow access to your
accounts and funds without any further requirements! After that, press next and
verify that you wrote down your brain key correctly:

**NOTE: While you only have to do this once to recover your balances, we recommend that you do this periodically to
avoid losing your transaction history.**
