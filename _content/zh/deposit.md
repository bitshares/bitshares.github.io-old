There are many ways to move funds into or out of the BitShares ecosystem.

--------

## Bridges/Gateways

Bridges/gateways are the recommended method of moving funds into or out of the network.
They simplify the process of moving funds from one blockchain-based crypto currency to another.
For instance, you can buy bitUSD with Bitcoin at (close to) market rates quickly.
Some services are:

- [BlockTrades](https://blocktrades.us/)
- [MetaExchange](https://metaexchange.info/)
- [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.io/)
- [BTSBots](https://www.btsbots.com/)
- [X-Chain](http://xchain.info/)
- [CryptoMate](https://cryptomate.co.uk/)
- [AltQuick](https://www.altquick.co/)

## Exchanges

Most crypto-currency exchanges offer a wide variety of different crypto currency pairs and in
contrast to bridges not only allow for instant trades at market price, but also offer to put a
buy/sell order at a desired price.
