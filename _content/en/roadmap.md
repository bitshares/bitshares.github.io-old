This is the high-level roadmap for the BitShares core development team. Detailed development discussion can be found at
the [official GitHub page](https://github.com/BitShares).

1. Announce BitShares 2.0 
2. Community Review and Modifications
3. Feature Freeze 
4. Achieve Full Test Coverage
4. Launch Public Test Network 
5. Fix Bugs Discovered by Public Test
6. Announce Snapshot Date (30 days notice)
7. Prepare Migration Tools
8. Upgrade to BitShares 2.0
9. Submit Proposals for New Features 

The future is a blank page, the BitShares stakeholders will be responsible for prioritizing funding for features once
BitShares 2.0 has been released.  As projects get approval they will be added to the roadmap.
