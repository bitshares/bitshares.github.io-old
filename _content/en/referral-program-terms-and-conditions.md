title: Referral Program Terms & Conditions
---

The BitShares Referral system does not constitute a contract between any two parties.  It's actual rules are
entirely defined by the BitShares source code and subject to the consensus of the network.  Any statements made
by this website are attempts to describe what the source code will automatically enforce.  The source code defines
the complete and accurate terms in an unambiguous manner and overrides any errors or ambiguity found in this
document.

### Terms

1. User - any account that has **not paid** a lifetime membership fee.
2. Member - any account that has paid a lifetime membership fee.
3. Registrar - an existing account that pays a transaction fee necessary to create new accounts.
4. Referrer -  A Member account, defined by Member Registrars, that receives a percentage of referral fees.

### Referral Process for Members

Any Member can also be a Registrar by creating an account for a friend.  By default the Registrar and Referrer are the same account and
will receive all of the referral rewards.   A Member Registrar may optionally assign a different Referrer and specify the
percentage of the referral rewards that go to the Registrar and to the Referrer.    Only Member accounts can be set as Referrers.

### Referral Process for Users

Any User can also be a Registrar by create an account for a friend; however, their friends account will be configured to have
the same Registrar and Referrer settings as the User.   There are no referrer rewards for regular Users.

### Becoming a Member

At any time any User account may upgrade to a Member by paying the Membership Fee set by the BTS Stakeholders.  When
a User account upgrades they become their own Registrar and Referrer.

### Reward Vesting Requirements

All cashback and referral income are deposited into a special balance which must vest linearly for 1 year.  This
means that after 6 months you can withdraw about 50% of your cash back, but your remaining funds will take an
additional year to vest.   This is because the vesting process is based upon accumulating "BTS-years", for
each *BTS-year* accumulated you can withdraw 1 BTS.  If you leave 100 BTS in the account for 1 year then you
will have accumulated 100 BTS-years and can withdraw 100 BTS.   On the other hand, if you withdraw 50 BTS after
6 months, then you will have consumed 50 BTS-years leaving your account with 50 BTS and 0 BTS-years.  It will take
a full year to accumulate another 50 BTS-years.

### Fees and Commissions

All fees are set by the BTS shareholders through the elected delegates.  Parameters on the referral program
such as the 80/20 split of transaction fees and the 1 year vesting of cash back rewards are also set by the
BTS shareholders.   These fees and parameters can change at any time with 2 weeks notice.  Funds held in vesting
balances will continue to vest under their original terms.

### User Issued Asset Fees

Some asset issuers may charge their own trading fees.   These fees are not part of the referral program.
