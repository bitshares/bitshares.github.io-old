summary: >
   BitShares is designed to be self funding and self-sustaining by giving the stakeholders the power to direct where
   blockchain reserves are spent.   BitShares has a reserve pool of 1.2 billion BTS (about $8 million dollars) that
   automatically grows as transaction fees are collected and the share price rises.   Each day the blockchain is
   authorized to spend up to 432,000 BTS (about $77,000 per month); enough to hire a small team to maintain the
   network for years even with no price appreciation.

## Income

The ultimate goal is for the network to collect more from transaction fees than it spends paying witnesses and
workers.   Delegates can adjust the transaction fees and referral commission rates to ensure that the network
is sustainable.  Proper pricing is important to ensure a sustainable business model. By charging fees that are appropriate and
distributing the income in an effective manner BitShares powered networks can grow while others struggle.
Members pay fees similar to Bitcoin ($0.04) while users pay fees similar to Dwolla ($0.20) or centralized exchanges (0.2%).

## Workers
A worker is an elected position that gets paid to fund new blockchain infrastructure.  Their employment "smart contract"
specifies a start date, an end date, a daily pay rate, and a vesting period for pay received. Each
day a budget is allocated totalling 432,000 BTS to be paid to the workers.  The workers are sorted by net
shareholder approval and paid in turn until the daily budget runs out.

Each worker can specify a vesting period for funds received.  This vesting period can be used to reassure stakeholders
that the pay received will not be dumped on the market immediately and that the worker has a long-term outlook.

## Refund Workers

Refund workers are a special worker type that returns its pay to the reserve pool.  These workers can be
elected to prevent spending on other workers that are deemed unnecessary.
